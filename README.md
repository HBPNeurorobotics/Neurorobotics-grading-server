# Neurorobotics-grading-server
NodeJS server designed to record student grades (MOOC) in a database 

## API

### edX launch request
A request of the form `POST /edx-launch` creates an entry in a Firestore database that holds parts of the request itself as well as a token. The token is generated by the grading server based on the request details. The token is returned in the request response for further use by the request owner (MOOC user). The token corresponds to a unique MOOC exercise and a unique MOOC user. Users are asked to provide their tokens when submitting their answers.

Below is typical Form Data provided by edX when performing such [LTI Launch](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#lti-launch) request.

The fields with prefix `custom_` are custom parameters that edX lets you specify through its graphical user interface for the creation of [LTI Components](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/lti_component.html).
The value of `lis_result_sourcedid` identifies uniquely a specific user and a specific exercise.
The URL `lis_outcome_service_url` is the URL to be used to grade eventually this exercise.

### Submission of an answer for a given MOOC exercise

A request of the form `POST /submission` creates an entry in a Firestore database that holds to the request body.
The request body must be of the following form

```
{
  "submissionInfo": {
    "header": "NRP MOOC Reinforcement Learning",
    "subheader": "Mini-project 0"
  },
  "answer" : { "1" : 123.5, "2": 10.0, "3": 5.6 },
  "fileContent": "# Some content",
  "fileName": "mySolution.py",
  "token": "2e9a12df4de102f9c1d4a6e9936940b21d4c78f5f84"
}
```
The `submissionInfo` identifies the MOOC via its `header` field and the MOOC exercise via its `subheader` field.
The `token` is the string provided by the response of `POST /edx-launch`. Users need to copy their tokens from the corresponding edX pages.
